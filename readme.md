# Data Analyst SQL Portfolio

This repository documents my **structured learning and hands-on practice in SQL** as part of my transition from **QA Analyst → Data Analyst / BI Analyst**.

The focus of this repository is **core SQL fundamentals, analytical patterns, and business-oriented problem solving**, not just syntax memorization.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Demonstrate **strong SQL fundamentals** expected in Data Analyst roles
- Show **analytical thinking** behind metrics, not just queries
- Build a recruiter-friendly, topic-wise SQL portfolio
- Reflect real-world reporting and interview scenarios

This repository is intentionally:
- Topic-wise (not random practice)
- Incremental and well-structured
- Focused on clarity, correctness, and business relevance

---

## 🧠 Skills Covered

- Data filtering and sorting
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- Derived metrics and KPI logic
- Conditional logic using `CASE`
- `WHERE` vs `HAVING` (interview-critical)
- Business interpretation of SQL results

Advanced topics (window functions, joins, case studies) will be added incrementally.
